# `HTTPConnection` class

When you want to define dependencies that should be compatible with both HTTP and WebSockets, you can define a parameter that takes an `HTTPConnection` instead of a `Request` or a `WebSocket`.

You can import it from `fastapi.requests`:

```
from fastapi.requests import HTTPConnection
```

## fastapi.requests.HTTPConnection 

```
HTTPConnection(scope, receive=None)
```

Bases: `Mapping[str, Any]`, `Generic[StateT]`

A base class for incoming HTTP connections, that is used to provide
any functionality that is common to both `Request` and `WebSocket`.

Source code in `starlette/requests.py`

```
def __init__(self, scope: Scope, receive: Receive | None = None) -> None:
    assert scope["type"] in ("http", "websocket")
    self.scope = scope
```

### scope `instance-attribute` 

```
scope = scope
```

### app `property`

### url `property`

### base\_url `property`

```

### headers `property`

### query\_params `property`

Source code in `starlette/requests.py`

```
def url_for(self, name: str, /, **path_params: Any) -> URL:
    url_path_provider: Router | Starlette | None = self.scope.get("router") or self.scope.get("app")
    if url_path_provider is None:
        raise RuntimeError("The `url_for` method can only be used inside a Starlette application or with a router.")
    url_path = url_path_provider.url_path_for(name, **path_params)
    return url_path.make_absolute_url(base_url=self.base_url)
